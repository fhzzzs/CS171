    "Note that the target $Y$ values are +1 and -1.  The internal nodes should all use the hyperbolic tangent (np.tanh) as the nonlinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write the two functions below (plus any more you would like to add to help): `nneval` and `trainneuralnet`.  The first takes an array/matrix of X vectors and the weights from a neural network and returns a vector of discriminant values (should be numbers between -infinity and +infinity).  The second takes a data set (Xs and Ys), the number of hidden units, and the lambda value (for l2-regularization), and returns the weights, Wts.  Wts[0] are the weights from the input to the first hidden layer.  Wts[1] are the weights from the first hidden layer to the second hidden layer.  Wts[2] are the weights from the second hidden layer to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes:\n",
    "- **Starting Weights**: The code supplied randomly selects the weights near zero.  https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-in-neural-networks-a-journey-from-the-basics-to-kaiming-954fb9b47c79 has a reasonable explanation of why we are doing it this way.  But for the purposes of the assignment, you can just accept this is a good way to initialize neural network weights.\n",
    "- **Offset Terms**: Each layer should have an \"offset\" or \"intercept\" unit (to supply a 1 to the next layer), except the output layer.\n",
    "- **Batch Updates**: For a problem this small, use batch updates.  That is, the step is based on the sum of the gradients for each data point in the training set.\n",
    "- **Step Size**: http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/#gradientdescentoptimizationalgorithms describes a number of methods to adaptively control $\\eta$ for fast convergence.  You don't need to understand any of them; however, without them, convergence to good solutions on this problem can be quite slow.  Therefore, *use RMSprop*: the code below has a simple version of RMSprop that is sufficient for this assignment.  You need to supply the code that calculates `sumofgrad2` which should be the sum of the square of each element of the *full* gradient (the squared length of the gradient including the regularization term).  (for debugging, feel free to use a constant $\\eta$ initially). \n",
    "- **Stopping Criterion**: To determine when to stop, check the loss (full loss, including the regularization term) function every 10 iterations.  If it has not improved by at least $10^{-6}$ over those 10 iterations, stop.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: You should penalize (from the regularization) all of the weights, even those coming out of offset units.  While it makes sense sometimes not to penalize the ones for the constant $1$ units, you'll find this easier if you just penalize them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips that might help:\n",
    "- Display the loss function's value every 10 iterations (or so).  It should be getting smaller.  If not, your gradient is not pointing in the right direction.\n",
    "- The smaller $\\lambda$ is and the more units, the more difficult (longer) the optimization will be.\n",
    "- Write a function to do forward propagation and one to do backward propagation.  Write a function to evaluate the loss function.  In general, break things up to keep things straight.\n",
    "- Processing the entire batch at once is more efficient in numpy than using a loop over the examples.  Use numpy broadcasting to avoid loops where possible.\n",
    "- Create a small dataset from the examples in class.  Check that you get the same results for forward propagation.  Check you get the same results for backward propagation.  Check that you get the same results for the gradients.\n",

    "More hidden units can represent complex functions, but also risk overfitting. As λ increases, it imposes a penalty for complexity, which can reduce overfitting. The plot shows that for lower values of λ, models with more hidden units perform better (lower error rates). However, for higher λ values, error rates increase sharply, possibly due to oversimplification of the model, leading to underfitting. This agrees with the theoretical understanding that regularization can prevent overfitting but also that too much regularization can lead to underfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory does not give any information about a sudden increase in validation error rate at certain lambda values. The performance of models with a large number of hidden units not degrading as expected with increasing lambda, if the plot showed that. In theory, as lambda increases, performance should degrade due to the model being too restricted.\n",
